# Building a Cybersecurity Lab: Active Directory, Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Kali Linux Integration

I have successfully built a lab environment centered around Active Directory, Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Kali Linux. The setup includes an Active Directory environment hosted on a Windows Server, with Splunk configured to ingest and analyze event data from both the Active Directory server and a target Windows machine. Additionally, Atomic Red Team is integrated to simulate various attack techniques, and a Kali Linux machine is used to perform a brute-force attack against the Active Directory environment. This documentation provides a detailed guide to setting up and configuring these components, offering practical insights into cybersecurity practices.

## Tools

- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox
- **Client Machines:**
  - Windows Server (Active Directory)
  - Target Windows 10 Machine
  - Kali Linux (Attacking Machine)
- **Security Monitoring:** Splunk (Installed on )
- **Attack Simulation:** Atomic Red Team and Kali linux
- **Telemetry and Logging:**
  - Sysmon (Installed on Windows Server and Target Windows Machine)
  - Splunk (Collecting logs from Windows Server and Target Windows Machine)
