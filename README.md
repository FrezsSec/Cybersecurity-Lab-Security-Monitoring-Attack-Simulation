# Building a Cybersecurity Lab: Active Directory, Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Kali Linux Integration

I have successfully built a lab environment centered around Active Directory, Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Kali Linux. The setup includes an Active Directory environment hosted on a Windows Server, with Splunk configured to ingest and analyze event data from both the Active Directory server and a target Windows machine. Additionally, Atomic Red Team is integrated to simulate various attack techniques, and a Kali Linux machine is used to perform a brute-force attack against the Active Directory environment. This documentation provides a detailed guide to setting up and configuring these components, offering practical insights into cybersecurity practices.
